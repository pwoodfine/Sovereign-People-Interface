# 📜 Executive Summary: Sovereign-Talent-Engine
**Revision:** 2030.01 // **Status:** Operational (Self-Healing Active)

### 1. Strategic Mandate
The Sovereign-Talent-Engine is a proprietary intelligence system designed to convert fragmented professional signals into a **Deterministic Personnel Substrate**. By treating all data as inherently unstructured, the engine uses "Gravity Scanning" to architect a clean, relational network for high-stakes strategic recruitment.

### 2. Architectural Pillars
* **Sovereign Host:** The central iMac 12.1 vault containing the `people.db` substrate and the **Chart of Archetypes (COA)**.
* **Infinite Gravity:** A file-agnostic ingestion method. Instead of rigid templates, extractors calculate "Identity Mass" to locate valid data within any file noise.
* **Self-Healing Core:** The `engine_core.py` brain. It automates identity resolution by "docking" new signals into existing personas, ensuring 1 Person = 1 Sovereign ID.

### 3. The Substrate Lifecycle (Chain of Custody)
1. **Harvest:** Raw signals are pulled from spreadsheets, social graphs, and logs.
2. **Heal:** The engine core merges fragments and stabilizes the Sovereign ID.
3. **Structure:** Reconciled records are "Socketed" into the database in `Discovery` status.
4. **Verify:** Human Nodes provide the final layer of professional truth.
5. **Maturate:** Records are enriched with context to score against the 20-point Digital Twin model.
