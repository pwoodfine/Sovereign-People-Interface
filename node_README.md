# 📡 Node Operation: Sovereign-Talent-Engine
**Location:** Distributed Mac OS X Stations
**Mission:** High-Fidelity Verification & Substrate Maturation

## I. Verification Protocols (The Bridge)
Nodes request high-priority "Work Packets" from the Host via the API Bridge.
* **`node_discovery.py`**: The primary operator interface. Utilizes **"Glance-and-Tap"** logic to verify identity existence and professional domain alignment.
* **`node_maturated.py`**: Background maturation daemon. Performs deep-text scraping on verified entities to calculate "Professional Elasticity" and update the 20-point model.

## II. Quality Assurance & Telemetry
* **`node_report_stats.py`**: Local performance tracking. Measures verification velocity and accuracy against the Host's "Information Gain" requirements.
* **Rotational Survey:** Operators cycle between Social, Corporate, and Direct verification modes to ensure substrate neutrality.

**Protocol:**
1. **Sync:** Verify connection to the Host IP.
2. **Execute:** Launch `node_discovery.py` to begin the verification queue.
3. **Commit:** All results are pushed to the Host substrate in real-time.
